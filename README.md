## Installing / Getting started

A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get a hello world
up & running.

```shell
commands here
```

Here you should say what actually happens when you execute the code
above.

## Contributing

We want your help. No really, we do.

There might be a little voice inside that tells you that you're not
ready; that you need to do one more tutorial, or learn another
framework, or write a few more blog posts before you can help us with
this project.

We assure you, that's not the case.

This project has some clear Contribution Guidelines and expectations
that you can [read here](CONTRIBUTING.md).

The contribution guidelines outline the process that you'll need to
follow to get a patch merged. By making expectations and process
explicit, we hope it will make it easier for you to contribute.

And you don't just have to write code. You can help out by writing
documentation, tests, or even by giving feedback about this work. (And
yes, that includes giving feedback about the contribution guidelines.)

Thank you for contributing!

## Developing

### Built With
List main libraries, frameworks used including versions (React, Angular
etc...)

### Prerequisites
What is needed to set up the dev environment. For instance, global
dependencies or any other tools. include download links.


### Setting up Dev

Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start
developing the project further:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your/your-project.git
cd your-project/
packagemanager install
```

And state what happens step-by-step. If there is any virtual
environment, local server or database feeder needed, explain here.

### Building

If your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build
the project after some code changes, state them here. for example:

```shell
./configure
make
make install
```

Here again you should state what actually happens when the code above
gets executed.

### Deploying / Publishing
give instructions on how to build and release a new version In case
there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a
server, this is the right time to state it.

```shell
packagemanager deploy your-project -s server.com -u username -p password
```

And again you'd need to tell what the previous code actually does.

## Versioning

We can maybe use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the
versions available, see the [link to tags on this repository](/tags).


## Configuration

Here you should write what are all of the configurations a user can
enter when using the project.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples. Explain what
these tests test and why.

```shell
Give an example
```

## Style guide

Explain your code style and show how to check it.

## Api Reference

If the api is external, link to api documentation. If not describe your
api including authentication methods as well as explaining all the
endpoints with their required parameters.


## Database

Explaining what database (and version) has been used. Provide download
links. Documents your database design and schemas, relations etc...

## Licensing

State what the license is and how to find the text version of the
license.
